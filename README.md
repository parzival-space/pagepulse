# PagePulse
A simple self-hosted status page that allows you to check the availability of your website, application or service. 
As long as its reachable using HTTP/HTTPS its supported.
The app also allows you to connect to databases using JDBC. 
By default it will create a SQLite database.

I personally deploy it in on one of my cloud servers and let it monitor the status of my applications: https://status.parzival.space/
